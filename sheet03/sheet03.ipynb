      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In this exercise, you will experiment with two different techniques to compute the principal components of a dataset:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Basic PCA**: The standard technique based on singular value decomposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Iterative PCA**: A technique that progressively optimizes the PCA objective function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Principal component analysis is applied here to modeling handwritten characters data (characters \"O\" and \"I\") using the dataset introduced in the paper \"L.J.P. van der Maaten. 2009. A New Benchmark Dataset for Handwritten Character Recognition\". The dataset consists of black and white images of $28 \\times 28$ pixels, each representing a handwritten character. For the purpose of the PCA analysis, these images are interpreted as 784-dimensional vectors with values between 0 and 1. Three methods are provided for your convenience and are available in the module `utils` that is included in the zip archive. The methods are the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`utils.load()`** load data from the file `characters.csv` and stores them in a data matrix of size $4631 \\times 784$. (The data is a subset of the original dataset available here: http://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/misc/characters.zip)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`utils.scatterplot(...)`** produces a scatter plot from a two-dimensional data set. Each point in the scatter plot represents one handwritten character. This method provides a convenient way to produce two-dimensional PCA plots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`utils.render(...)`** takes a matrix of size $n \\times 784$ as input, interprets it as $n$ images of size $28 \\times 28$, and renders these images in the IPython notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "A demo code that makes use of these methods is given below. It performs basic data analysis, for example, plotting simple statistics for each data point in the dataset, or rendering a few examples randomly selected from the dataset."
