      "In this exercise sheet, you will experiment with training various support vector machines on a subset of the MNIST dataset composed of digits 5 and 6. First, download the MNIST dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, uncompress the downloaded files, and place them in a `data/` subfolder. Install the optimization library CVXOPT (`python-cvxopt` package, or directly from the website `www.cvxopt.org`). This library will be used to optimize the dual SVM in part A.\n",
